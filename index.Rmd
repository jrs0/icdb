This website contains all the information you need to understand what the library is, how to use it, and how it is designed and tested. 

ICDB is a library for connecting to health care databases, with features designed to make data analysis using these databases easier. **The library is not fully developed yet. Expect the interface and other features to change.** In addition, expect this documentation website to be updated with time.
