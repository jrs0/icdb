## Welcome to the documentation for ICDB!

This website contains all the information you need to understand what the library is, how to use it, and how it is designed and tested. 

ICDB is a library for connecting to health care databases, with features designed to make data analysis using these databases easier. **The library is not fully developed yet. Expect the interface and other features to change.** In addition, expect this documentation website to be updated with time.
