\description{
This function is a replacement for the dplyr::collect() function
that is used to submit an SQL query to a database. This function
is called in the same way, by piping to collect(), but it caches
the query behind the scenes, so that the next time the query is
fetched, the results are available quicker.
}
\details{
In order to avoid ambiguity caused by the order in which icdb and
dplyr are loaded, this function is not called collect. You can still
use collect, but
