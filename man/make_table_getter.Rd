make_table_getter(con, database, table_schema, table_name, id = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{con}{The database connection (from Server)}

\item{database}{The database name}

\item{table_schema}{The table schema name}

\item{table_name}{The table name}

\item{id}{You can also pass the complete Id, if it is available}

\description{
Make a function that returns a table getter. The function which
is returned can be called to produce a Table object.
}
\details{
This function is the way to associate a function with every table
object in the db list, and replaces the need to overload \code{$}, while
also avoiding the problem of storing the table name and database
name in the functions environment. This is the purpose of a function
factory; to capture variables in the enclosing environment and allow
them to persist when the function is called. Read this page and the
associated environment sections for a full explanation:
https://adv-r.hadley.nz/function-factories.html

Even though the code uses () to access the table name, this level
of indirection is still necessary because of the bug referenced
in the build_object_tree body -- using a table getter means that
the tbl is only created when the user asks for it, removing some
edge cases with "bad" tables (like COLUMNS_EXTENSIONS in mysql
information_schema, which contains JSON columns).
