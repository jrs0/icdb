\format{
An object of class \code{Cache} of length 1.
}
\usage{
querycache
}
\description{
Note: This was previously called cache, but that conflicted with the Cache
object (can't have upper and lower case filenames in package). Need to think
of a better name, but this will do for now. Might get rid of the object
entirely.
