```
New code should conform with the rules listed in this file. The current code does not currently conform to all the points. This will be fixed with time.

## Choice of object-oriented systems

* Classes should use the S3 system. R6 is to be used in only two cases: the implementation of the server class; and the implementation of the cache. Any other cases must be listed explicitly here. Do not use S4. 

## Naming conventions

* Use lower-case words separated by underscores for functions and classes.

## Package-related

* Do not use tidyverse in documentation pages. The package should not depend on tidyverse (do not call use_package("tidyverse")).
