International classification of diseases (ICD) codes are used to identify different medical conditions in the database. ICDB has a number of utilities for automatically processing ICD codes, which are described on this page.

## ICD Code Mapping Files

The input to the ICDB library, which controls the parsing and interpretation of ICD codes, is a _codes mapping file_, which has the following format:

```
categories:
  cond-1::
    docs: "This is condition 1"
	codes: ["I2%","I3%"]
    categories:
	  sub-cond-1:
	    docs: "A subcondition"
		codes: "I233"
	  sub-cond-2:
	    docs: "Another condition"
		codes: ["I234", "I245"]
  cond-2:
    docs: "Something else"
	codes: "I444"
```

The file is defined by a set of nested "categories" blocks. Each of these blocks defines a set of codes, contains documentation describing what the category is, and may contain further categories block. The codes mapping file is in YAML format.
