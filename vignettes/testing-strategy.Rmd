This page contains all the details for how ICDB is tested. 

## Connection layer

## Mapping layer

## Dataset layer

## ICD API access

ICDB uses the [WHO ICD API](https://icd.who.int/icdapi) to generate configuration files for parsing diagnosis columns in the database. To check that this works, two functions are mocked:

* The authentication function, which gets an access token for making API requests. 
* The request function itself, which returns endpoint data

The mock functions are made to return data using the same format as the API, and then the tests are written to ensure that this fictional response is processed correctly.
