The page describes the general plan for ensuring that the main branch does not break. Currently, the repository is in a very early development stage, so breaking changes will not matter too much, but over time more tests and checks will be added to keep everything working.

## The main branch

The idea is that the main branch always works. The branch is protected, meaning it is not possible to directly push to it. Instead, you must create a pull request, meeting the requirements below:

* The R CMD Check must pass (devtools::check())
* Test coverage must exceed 60% (this number will increase with time)
* The documentation must build successfully
