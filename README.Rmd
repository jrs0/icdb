The goal of rdatabase is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of rdatabase like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(rdatabase)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Code completedness

The functions in the package are labelled according to a 5 point scale (0-4),
according to the following criteria:

- 0: An initial version of the function has been written, but lacks either 
documentation or testing
- 1: The function has an initial version that also has initial documentation 
and is covered by some preliminary tests
- 2: To be confirmed...
- 3: To be confirmed...
- 4: To be confirmed...

These scores are provided at the end of the documnentation for each function
as a line of the form "doneness: 2/4". You can take this as an indication of what
kind of state the function is in, and what needs most work.
