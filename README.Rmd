# icdb (ICB-DB)

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of icdb is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of icdb like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(icdb)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Code completedness

The functions in the package are labelled according to a 5 point scale (0-4),
according to the following criteria:

- 0: An initial version of the function has been written, but lacks either 
documentation or testing
- 1: The function has an initial version that also has initial documentation 
and is covered by some preliminary tests
- 2: To be confirmed...
- 3: To be confirmed...
- 4: To be confirmed...

These scores are provided at the end of the documnentation for each function
as a line of the form "doneness: 2/4". You can take this as an indication of what
kind of state the function is in, and what needs most work.

If there is no doneness label, assume that the function is incomplete.

## Todo list

Here is a list of improvements that need to be made:

- Connect to the server, not a database. Arrange things so that the user can autocomplete databases before tables. Try to make it work so that the same database connection can be used in multiple dplyr pipe operations.
- Flush the level1 cache to the disk at some point (i.e. when the session ends) to shorten the load time next session. Make sure there is a clear way to disable this (it might not be a desirable default).
- Need to try to get autocomplete working in every context it makes sense (col names etc.).
- Look into replacing dbSendQuery with dbGetQuery for simplicity 
- Really need to find a way to lazily evaluate the contents of the Databases object. Currently, all the databases and tables are stored because the current autocomplete method rests of built-in autocompletion of lists -- however, this requires the list to be populated. It would be better to find a different autocomplete method that allowed lazy evaluation of completion options.
- Need to reconcile the mysql and sql server (microsoft) way of getting lists of databases and tables. mysql returns objects properly using dbListObjects, but sql server lists the databases in a table and then there is no clear way to get the tables without raw sql.
