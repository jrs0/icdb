Welcome to the documentation for ICDB!
--------------------------------------

This website contains all the information you need to understand what
the library is, how to use it, and how it is designed and tested.

ICDB is a library for connecting to health care databases, with features
designed to make data analysis using these databases easier. **The
library is not fully developed yet. Expect the interface and other
features to change.** In addition, expect this documentation website to
be updated with time.
