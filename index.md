**This website is not finished yet**

This website contains all the information you need to understand what the library is, how to use it, and how it is designed and tested.

ICDB is a library for connecting to health care databases, with features designed to make data analysis easier. **The library is not fully developed yet. Expect the interface and other features to change.** In addition, expect this documentation website to be updated with time.

## Important pages

You can find the current state of library development in *Internals -> Status*. Have a look at the *Get Started* page if you want to see what the library (currently) does.
