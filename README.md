The goal of icdb is to …

## Installation

You can install the development version of icdb like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(icdb)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'icdb'
#> The following object is masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     table
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
summary(cars)
#>      speed           dist       
#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
#>  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
#>  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
#>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
#>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
#>  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

## Code completedness

The functions in the package are labelled according to a 5 point scale
(0-4), according to the following criteria:

  - 0: An initial version of the function has been written, but lacks
    either documentation or testing
  - 1: The function has an initial version that also has initial
    documentation and is covered by some preliminary tests
  - 2: To be confirmed…
  - 3: To be confirmed…
  - 4: To be confirmed…

These scores are provided at the end of the documnentation for each
function as a line of the form “doneness: 2/4”. You can take this as an
indication of what kind of state the function is in, and what needs most
work.
