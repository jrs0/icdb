              Cancellations\r\n\r\nWhere, for any reason, a PATIENT cancels or does
              not attend an APPOINTMENT or an OFFER OF ADMISSION the EARLIEST REASONABLE
              OFFER DATE for the rearranged APPOINTMENT or OFFER OF ADMISSION will
              be the EARLIEST REASONABLE OFFER DATE of the cancelled APPOINTMENT or
              OFFER OF ADMISSION.\r\n\r\nProvider Cancellations\r\n\r\nWhere, for
              any reason, any Health Care Provider cancels and re-arranges an APPOINTMENT
              or an OFFER OF ADMISSION, the EARLIEST REASONABLE OFFER DATE for the
              re-arranged APPOINTMENT or OFFER OF ADMISSION will be the date of the
              earliest Reasonable Offer made following the cancellation.\r\n\r\nPatients
              who are unavailable\r\n\r\nWhere a PATIENT makes themself unavailable
              for a longer period of time, for example a PATIENT who is a teacher
              who wishes to delay their admission until the summer holidays, making
              a Reasonable Offer may be inappropriate.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances,
              so long as the Health Care Provider could have made at least two Reasonable
              Offers, the EARLIEST REASONABLE OFFER DATE will be the date of the earliest
              Reasonable Offer that the provider could have offered the PATIENT. This
              must be communicated to the PATIENT."
